pam_testprompt is a pam module useful for testing conversation
functions of supposedly pam conformable applications.

For example in order to test the 'su' program change the content of
/etc/pam.d/su to

---8<---
#%PAM-1.0
auth        required       pam_testprompt.so
account     required       pam_testprompt.so
password    required       pam_testprompt.so
session     required       pam_testprompt.so
session     optional       pam_xauth.so
---8<---

put the following into /etc/security/pam_testprompt_auth.conf:

---8<---
PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF Password:

---8<---

'su' now behaves like normal except that no actual authentication
takes place.

The first column in pam_testprompt_{auth,password,session}.conf
specifies the type of the prompt. Possible values are
PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF, PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON, PAM_ERROR_MSG,
PAM_TEXT_INFO. The rest of the line is the string the pam
application is supposed to print. A single empty new line indicates
the end of a conversation specification. Typical real world pam
modules only use one prompt per conversation like asking for the
password in the example above. It's possible to put multiple prompts
into one conversation though. GUI applications may use that to
display a form instead of asking single questions. Example:

---8<---
PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON Forname: 
PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON Surname: 

PAM_TEXT_INFO Moin!

---8<---

pam_testprompt also allows to simulation of failures of pam modules
by returning an error value. You can specify the return value in the
pam config file. For example in order to tell the applications that
the user needs to change his password you may add the following line
to the pam config:

---8<---
account     required       pam_testprompt.so ret=PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD
---8<---
